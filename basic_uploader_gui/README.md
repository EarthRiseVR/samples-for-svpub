This tool will allow you to upload a single video file that contains a CAMM track with all necessary geo-metadata.

Before you can use the tool, you must add your streetviewpublish_config.json file in the same folder, replace the placeholder value for KEY at the beginning of the script, and then build the app by running py2app with setup.py.

In addition to the dependencies described in the root README, you will also need ffmpeg-python, pyexiftool, wxpython, and py2app.
